### Project
Assessing the influence of hydrologic model complexity on snowmelt and streamflow simulation

### Short Bio
Marian is undertaking her Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP), a research internship in Winter 2024. Her research focues on data uncertainty and hydrologic prediction under climate change. Marian will construct hydrologic models to simulate hydrological processes, and explore the impacts of meteorological and streamflow data uncertainty on hydrologic simulation results, which is an extremely important research topic under climate change.
