### Project
Understanding Dominant Hydrological Processes and Model Parameters in Mountainous Regions: A Case Study of the Bow at Banff

### Project Abstract
Hannah completed her Deanâ€™s Research Award in Fall 2023. Her research focused on uncovering how water behaves in mountainous areas, taking the Bow at Banff basin as a case study. Specifically, she identified the dominant physics processes and model parameters, aiding an accurate representation of water behaviors in hydrological models. By doing this project, Hannah gained hands-on experience in conducting sensitivity analysis for process-based hdrologic models.
