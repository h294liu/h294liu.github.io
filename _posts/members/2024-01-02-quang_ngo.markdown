### Project
Assessing the influence of hydrologic model complexity on snowmelt and streamflow simulation

### Short Bio
Quang is undertaking his Dean's Research Award in Fall 2023 and continuing through Winter 2024. His research investigates whether enhancing the snow-related spatial representation, through refined spatial discretization, can bring us improved streamflow prediction in mountainous regions. The hypothesis is that better considering the snow-related characteristics in spatial discretization can enhance our ability of streamflow prediction.
