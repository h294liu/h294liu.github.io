Our Hydrology research group aims to advance process-based hydrologic modeling, and its application in prediction and impact assessment under climate change. We work on many different aspects of hydrologic sciences, including but not limited to uncertainty quantification, spatial discretization, parameter estimation, ensemble streamflow forecasting, and climate change impact assessment. The work uses in situ and remote sensing data, integrates machine learning with process-based hydrologic modeling, and runs large-domain simulations on supercomputers. Our group is passionate about conducting open, reproducible, and collaborative research. The research outcomes will improve the usefulness of hydrologic observations and models in water engineering and interdisciplinary problems.
