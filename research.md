<p>
Our research group aims to advance process-based hydrologic modeling, and its application in predictions (including floods and droughts) and impact assessment under climate change. Specifically, we seek to: (1) uncover the underlying causes of extreme hydrologic events, (2) enhance the representation of hydrologic processes in models, (3) minimize uncertainty in model outputs, and (4) generate ensemble hydrologic predictions under future climate scenarios. See below for examples.
<br>
<br>
Our research uses in situ and remote sensing data, integrates machine learning with process-based hydrologic modeling, and runs large-domain simulations on supercomputers. We are passionate about conducting open, reproducible, and collaborative research. Our research outcomes will improve the usefulness of hydrologic observations and models in water engineering and interdisciplinary problems.

        <p>
        This research develops insights into the underlying causes of flooding events by leveraging advanced analytical techniques. Additionally, we examine the impact of climatic change on flood magnitude and frequency, and predict future floods by considering various environmental changes.

        <h4 id="paragraph1">Enhancing Parameter Estimation</h4>
        <p>
        Accurate parameter estimation, or model calibration, is essential for enhancing model reliability and predictive capability. Our research uses machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency of sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation in large-scale hydrologic model applications.

        <h4 id="paragraph2">Optimizing Model Complexity</h4>
        <p>
        Model complexity and process representation are highly dependent on spatial discretization (i.e., dividing a domain into homogeneous computational units, such as grids or hydrologic response units). Our research focuses on generalizing guidelines for determining the appropriate model complexity to represent the spatial heterogeneity across scales.

        <p>
        Hydrologic modeling and forecasting face various sources of uncertainty. We embrace uncertainty and work to accurately quantify the uncertainties in both historical and real-time meteorological and hydrometric observations. We also develop methodologies to utilize these uncertain data in hydrologic modeling, data assimilation, and flood mapping.
